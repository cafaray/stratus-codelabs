I. 

In the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, definition of "cloud computing", what does the statement "shared pool of configurable computing resources" include?

+ Networks, servers, storage, applications, and services
Data security, associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption
Leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider
Five essential characteristics, three deployment models, three service models

correct
Answer
Correct:These are all recognized as computing resources that can be configured as needed and shared.

What tasks do hypervisors accomplish? Select two.

* Enable multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources.
Facilitate access to mainframes for multiple users to access the same data storage layer.
Scale on demand to support fluctuating workloads.
* Separates VMs logically and assigns each a share of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage.

correct
Answer
Correct:Correct! A hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources. Hypervisors also separate virtual machines logically, assigning each its own slice of the underlying computing power, memory and storage, preventing the virtual machines from interfering with each other.

What are some of the cloud benefits that make it lower risk for enterprises to adopt cloud? Select two.

Data security associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption
* The pay-as-you-go model allows enterprises to experiment with technologies as opposed to making long-term decisions based on little or no trial.
Diversity of standardization in how the constantly evolving technologies integrate and interoperate.
* The speed with which applications can be up and running on the cloud versus months on traditional platforms, means enterprises can experiment, fail fast, learn, and course correct without setting them back significantly.

correct
Answer
Correct:Correct! Renting by the hour as opposed to the huge upfront cost of investing and re-investing in hardware and software make cloud adoption a low-risk option for enterprises. The speed and productivity provided by the cloud makes cloud adoption lower-risk for enterprises.

II.

Which are some of the key components of cloud infrastructure? Select two.

IaaS providers manage the hypervisors and provision virtual instances
IaaS providers deploy the middleware and install required applications on the virtual machines
* IaaS providers manage large data centers that contain the physical machines required to power the various layers of abstraction on top of them
* IaaS providers manage the hypervisors and end-users provision the virtual instances

Answer
Correct: In most IaaS models, end users do not interact directly with the physical infrastructure but experience it as a service provided to them. The cloud providers manage the hypervisors, but the virtual instances are provisioned by the end-users as per their needs.

Which of these statements are true of Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)? Select two.

* VPCs are provisioned in a logically isolated part of a shared public cloud
* The VPC infrastructure is owned, managed, and operated by the public cloud service provider
VPCs may be provisioned over a cloud service provider’s infrastructure, but the infrastructure is owned, managed, and operated by the enterprise
VPC allows all users of the shared public cloud to access resources in the VPC on need basis; it also allows users of the VPC to access resources of the public cloud

Answer
Correct: A VPC is a public cloud offering that lets an organization establish its own private and secure cloud-like computing environment in a logically isolated part of a shared public cloud. While the infrastructure is tailored to an individual organization’s unique needs, it is still owned, managed, and operated by the public cloud service provider.

If an organization needs to run a highly sensitive and mission critical application with unpredictable performance and capacity requirements, which of the following models would best meet its requirements?

Public Cloud
* Hybrid Cloud
On-premise Data Centers
Private Cloud

Answer
Correct: With a Hybrid Cloud, organizations can choose to run their mission-critical applications on the private cloud while leveraging additional public cloud capacity to accommodate spikes in demand for their application.
